THE REASON WHY WE CHOSE RELATIONAL DATABASE SYSTEM

-> Databases are an essential back-end feature of most software applications. They are where all data is collected, stored and organized. Whenever you conduct a web        search, log in to an account or complete an online transaction, a database system is silently recording the information in a structured manner. This makes data access    simple and reliable in the future. 

-> It provides an intuitive way to represent data and allows easy access to related data points.

-> It is also - simplistic
              - robust
              - flexible 
              - has better performance 
              - scalable and compatible in managing generic data.
